# CountCode

A simple bash script allowing to count the code of a given source directory.

I use it to get some stats of my .NET development reason of which the paths specific to .NET are filtered

## Usage
```./code_count.sh <your_project_path>```

or if you want Markdown results:

```./code_count.sh <your_project_path> md```
